        This Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect unless and until the Company
        terminates your Account or your right to access the Platform. The Company may terminate or
        suspend your Account and access to the Platform at any time with or without notice if we
        believe you have breached any representation, warranty, promise, agreement or other
        provision stated in the Agreement, or for any other reason, with or without cause, in its
        sole discretion. Upon such termination or suspension, you will not be entitled to any refund
        of unused fees (if any). The Company is not required to disclose, and may be prohibited by
        law from disclosing, the reason for the termination or suspension of your Account. After
        your Account is terminated for any reason, all terms of this terms of use survive such
        termination, and continue in full force and effect, except for any terms that by their
        nature expire or are fully satisfied. You may not cancel or terminate this Terms of Use
        without our express written consent. Any provisions in this Terms of Use that must survive
        to give effect to its meaning or enforceability for disputes arising during its effective
        term (including the following sections on disclaimers and liability limitations, governing
        law, jurisdiction, and dispute resolution) will survive any termination, cancellation, or
        invalidation.
