      <Styled.Text>
        Mindful of the high cost of litigating disputes, not only in dollars but also in time and
        energy, the parties hereto agree to the following dispute resolution procedure: In the event
        of any claim, controversy, cause of action, or dispute arising out of or related to any
        conduct on the Platform or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this
        Terms of Use, the other parts of the Agreement, or any portion(s) thereof (“Dispute”), the
        complaining party shall first attempt in good faith to settle such Dispute by delivering
        written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances (including any
        relevant documentation) of the Dispute, and allowing the receiving party thirty (30) days
        since the date of notice delivery to respond.

          <Styled.SubHeading component="li">Arbitration & Jurisdiction</Styled.SubHeading>
          <Styled.Text>
            Any Dispute between you and the Company that arises in whole or in part from the
            Platform, and which is not resolved informally within thirty (30) days after notice is
            delivered in accordance with the preceding paragraph, will be exclusively resolved by
            binding arbitration before JAMS in Los Angeles, California, U.S.A. If an arbitrator
            cannot be mutually agreed upon within sixty (60) days after the date the Dispute first
            arose, each of the disputing parties will choose an arbitrator and those arbitrators
            will then select another arbitrator to conduct the arbitration and render a final
            decision. However, the arbitration award shall be binding on the parties and limited to
            findings of fact to which the parties agree to be bound. After the conclusion of the
            arbitration, either party may submit the remaining (non-factual) issues in the Dispute
            to a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of California to pursue a final and an
            enforceable judgment.

          <Styled.SubHeading component="li">Claim Limitations & Waivers</Styled.SubHeading>
          <Styled.Text>
            EACH CLAIM INVOLVING A DISPUTE MUST BE BROUGHT TO ARBITRATION WITHIN TWELVE (12) MONTHS
            AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH SUCH CLAIM AROSE OR IT WILL BE IRREVOCABLY WAIVED. ARBITRATION
            SHALL PROCEED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS WITHOUT THE RIGHT FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES
            TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS. YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A CLASS ACTION
            LAWSUIT. YOU ALSO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AS WELL AS YOUR
            RIGHT TO CLAIM THAT CLARK COUNTY, IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., IS AN INCONVENIENT
            OR IMPROPER FORUM OR VENUE TO HEAR AND RESOLVE ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES CONCERNING THIS
            AGREEMENT.

          <Styled.SubHeading component="li">Damages and Irreparable Harm</Styled.SubHeading>
          <Styled.Text>
            The parties hereto further agree that a presiding court of competent jurisdiction’s
            damages award will be limited to compensatory damages at most, and that no punitive,
            treble, or consequential damages may be awarded. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you
            acknowledge that the unauthorized use of the Platform or Content could cause irreparable
            harm to the Company and our other users, and that in the event of your unauthorized use,
            we will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, temporary restraining order,
            and all other remedies available at law or in equity.

          <Styled.SubHeading component="li">Law Enforcement Compliance</Styled.SubHeading>
          <Styled.Text>
            Nothing contained in the Agreement limits our right to comply with law enforcement or
            other governmental or legal requests or requirements relating to your use of the
            Platform, or to the information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use.
            We may, at our sole discretion, determine whether a particular piece of your Content
